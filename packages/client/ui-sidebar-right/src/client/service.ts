/**
 * `ctx.sidebarRight`: what other plugins may ask of this column.
 *
 * The surface is per session and its state lives in that session's store
 * instance, which the slot runtime mints per session and a root service cannot
 * reach on its own. The plugin adopts each session's store instance as the
 * runtime mints it, so the controller reaches any session's store by id and
 * syncs the Tab domain from that store's commits, on screen or not.
 *
 * The plugin also names the Session on screen — the selected Session while the
 * Conversation fills the main column — from the selection and the main panel,
 * before React renders either change, and publishes it as `mounted`. Every
 * command on the public face acts on that Session through its adopted store; a
 * command with no Session on screen, or with one whose store the runtime has not
 * minted, has nothing to act on and fails loudly rather than writing into a
 * surface nobody is drawing. The seats never publish which Session they draw:
 * they report only what they render with, the room their docking kit measured
 * and the automatic fullscreen rule of their frame width.
 *
 * A tab's own actions (`tabActions`) aim at the session the tab is in, not at
 * the on-screen one: they run through that session's adopted store, so a callback
 * fired after the user switched sessions still lands where its tab is, and they
 * do nothing for a session whose store was never minted.
 *
 * `openResource` and `openTab` are the navigation controller, and every way
 * into the column is a call to one of them: the conversation's file links, a
 * tool row's line reference, the strip's add control, a guide entry box, a file
 * tree's rows. A resource is claimed through the registry by address; a page is
 * named by kind and recorded at the address this package composes for it. Both
 * hand the store one settled intent and record the navigation in the Tab
 * domain. Placement is the caller's option, never a type's property.
 *
 * The registration adopts Session stores, names the on-screen Session, and
 * forwards the seats' reports; callers use the service's navigation methods.
